            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                <b>KAPE SINA UNA</b> is a unique coffee shop originally situated on Marcos Highway in Antipolo City, where it offers a mesmerizing view of the surrounding mountains. Instead of a traditional storefront, it operates from the trunk of a parked MPV (multi-purpose vehicle), which has been cleverly converted into a coffee-serving hub. The setup includes an open trunk, an extended makeshift roof, and a handful of wooden tables and chairs. This unconventional setting distinguishes it from the usual family tailgate picnics you might encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accountant Mark Macul and engineer Mc-Neil Manauis are the men behind Kape Sina Una. According to him, they are still looking for a permanent place for their small business. They picked the current spot for its view. Some of their customers include bikers and cyclists taking a break from the physically demanding mountain roads of Antipolo.
            </p>
            <p>
                They named their coffee shop Kape Sina Una after the Tagalog word <b>“sinauna”</b> which means <b>“ancient”</b>. Mark and Mc-Neil wanted a name that would reflect the surroundings, the “probinsiya feels” to be exact.
            </p>
